# Scrapy_Projects
This repo contains all HPFB (Health Product and Food Branch) projects about scraping PDF/XML/HTTP/TXT/XLSX files by using [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/). Scrapy is an application framework for crawling web sites and extracting structured data which can be used for a wide range of useful applications, like data mining, information processing or historical archival. All scraped items are indexed into [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch), which is an upcoming powerful search engine.

An example of Scrapy Architecture can be found in [here](https://github.com/jasonjang714/HPFB_Scrapy_Projects/tree/master/superscrapy). For more information, please visit [Scrapy documentation](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/index.html).

To check similarity by using Cosine Algorithm, please refer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8897593/similarity-between-two-text-documents). For language detection, please check [Apache tika](https://tika.apache.org/).

Please make sure to change all directories before running.
