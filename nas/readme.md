## 2017 New Active Substances (NAS) in Canada
All new substance approved (or marketed) in 2017 can be referred to: [Health Canada New Drug Authorizations: 2016 Highlights](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/publications/drugs-health-products/health-canada-new-drug-authorizations-2016-highlights.html#a6).

NAS can be mapped with Drug Products recorded in Masterlist, which contains DIN (Drug Identification Number), PM (Product Monographs) Numbers, ATC Codes, etc.

All active PM Numbers can be scraped by using packages: [PDFMiner](https://github.com/euske/pdfminer) and [Tesseract-OCR](https://github.com/openpaperwork/pyocr)

Use [pandas dataframe](https://chrisalbon.com/python/pandas_dataframe_load_xls.html) to open Excel files.
